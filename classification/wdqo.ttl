In this situation, if one does not want to create a proper entity, the technique consists in creating a statement that has one of the fields as object and the others as qualifiers.

Examples

- the apparent magnitude of an astronomical object is a pair (brightness, wavelength filter), it is represented as 
    (astronomical object, apparent magnitude, brightness-value)[astronomical filter: wavelength filter]
the object of the statement is the brightness and the filter is given by the atronomical filter qualifer.
- the genomic start and end of a gene is a number and a  chromosome identifier
- the catalog code} of some entity is a string together with a  catalog identifier 
- the boiling point of a substance is a number (temperature) and a pressure {under pressure)

Without this information the statement does not make sense, except if there is a well-known default value. 
- the statement (2004 Tour de France Stage 11, stage classification, Juan Antonio Flecha) [rank: 2]) would be meaningless without the rank: 2 qualification. Without rank: 2 the information brought by the statement is limited to: Juan Antonio Flecha participated in 2004 Tour de France, Stage 11}, which is certainly not the intended meaning of the classification} property.

Many of these qualifiers have a very low diversity index, i.e. they are very specific to a property. For instance, \\textsf{astronomical filter} qualifies almost exclusively \\textsf{apparent magnitude}""" .
