The following list contains the most frequent wikidata qualifier names. These qualifiers are used to either contextualize statments, e.g. by providing a time validity (start date, end date), or to provide additional information about the statement or the subjet or the object of the statement. Can you provide a semantic classification or taxonomy of these qualifiers that could help wikidata users to select the right qualifiers when creating a new statement.
